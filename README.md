Platform for a sales team to manage client cases.


# Code overview (section is currently a work in progress)

Currently, we have the interaction_manager and storage_manager classes. It should be quite easy to find them. The interaction_manager handles all user interaction, while the storage_manager handles data manupulation tasks.

Notice that the current implementation is very rudimentary and monolithic. We expect a lot of refactoring to happen in the course of the project.
